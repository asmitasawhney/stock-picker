# stock-picker
This an incredibly basic program to aid in picking stock options. This is absolutely not a comprehensive way to pick "the best" investing options, but is meant to serve as a starting point. 

The criteria used to evaluate stocks are based on advice from [Rose Shafa](https://www.roseshafa.com/) as defined in her blog and youtube videos. I may change the program as I find gaps in the methodology. 

## Methodoly 

1. Start by picking a firm that has some sort of a competitive advantage and is looking to be profitable in the long-term.
2. Evaluate its EPS (Earnings per share) to ensure a positive upward trend.

    [EPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/eps.asp) is a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. It is an indication of how much a company makes for each share of its stock and is a metric for a company's profitablity.
