# stock-picker
This an incredibly basic program to aid in picking stock options. This is absolutely not a comprehensive way to pick "the best" investing options, but is meant to serve as a starting point. 

The criteria used to evaluate stocks are based on advice from [Rose Shafa](https://www.roseshafa.com/) as defined in her blog and youtube videos. I may change the program as I find gaps in the methodology.
